# JAVA-DSA-Practice-Programs

Java programs demonstrating fundamental concepts in data structures, algorithms, and Java APIs. It includes implementations of common sorting techniques like bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quick sort. The collection also covers classic algorithm problems such as matrix multiplication and finding the longest common subsequence.

In addition, there are examples showcasing Java collections like ArrayList, LinkedList, Queue, HashMap, and HashSet, highlighting how to use them effectively. Some files deal with string manipulation problems like identifying the first unique or non-repeating character.

There are also practical examples such as reading data from files and connecting to a database using JDBC. Functional programming with lambda expressions is introduced as well, making this repository a comprehensive resource for learning core Java programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.
